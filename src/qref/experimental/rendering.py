"""Experimental visualization capabilities for QREF.

Currently, the visualizations are done with graphviz, which does not suport
hierarchical structures. Therefore, we have to use a somewhat hacky representation
of our routines:

- The leaf nodes are drawn as a single graphviz node (this is not surprising) with
  Mrecord shape. This allows to visually separate routine name from its ports.
- The non-leaf nodes are represented as clusters.
  - Clusters can't use Mrecord shape, and so the ports are drawn as separate nodes.
  - Input and output ports are grouped into subgraphs with the same rank, which
    forces all inputs / all outputs to be placed in a single column.

Because of the above dichotomy, care has to be taken when constructing edges.
- If addressing port of a leaf, it must be specified as graphviz port, e.g:
  "root.child:in_0"
- If addressing port of a non-leaf, you use normal node reference, e.g:
  "root.child.in_0"
